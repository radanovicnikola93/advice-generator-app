## Overview
The challenge was to build out this advice generator app using the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

## My process

- Writing semantic HTML5
- Styled the page with CSS3 with custom properties
- When the page was looking ok on mobile and desktop version I fetched the data to change the content on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript (fetch API)

### What I learned

- Getting more understanding in fetch API

```js
fetch(url)
  .then()
  .catch()
```

### Useful resources

- [GET fetch API](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data) - This helped me for fetch the data. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
